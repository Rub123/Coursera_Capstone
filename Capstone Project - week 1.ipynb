The project is peer-reviewed. The objective of the project is to come up with a creative idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighbourhoods or cities. Alternatively, to come up with a problem that can be solved by using the Foursquare location data."

    "My project is devoted to exploring and clustering elementary schools in Tel Aviv (a major city located in the center of Israel), based on their proximity to other venues that are of particular interest to the client. The project aims to provide clients, who wish to live in close proximity to a school, with data concerning other venues in the area, in order to assist them in understanding and narrowing down their choices and eventually deciding where to rent an apartment.

    "I was inspired to create this project by a friend of mine, who is interested in moving with his family to the city of Tel Aviv. My friend, who currently lives in a suburban area, works in Tel Aviv and spends hours each day in traffic. He and his wife have decided to move to the city, sell their car and travel mainly by foot or, if necessary, public transportation. While he works in Tel Aviv, my friend is unfamiliar with most of its neighbourhoods and needs my advice on the best area to search for an apartment."

    "Despite Tel Aviv being my hometown, I soon realized how easily one could become overwhelmed when approaching such a decision. Tel Aviv is Israel’s second most populous city, with approximately 450,000 residents. It is the financial capital of Israel, with the largest economy per capita in the Middle East. It hosts countless venues, including numerous schools and education venues. Its many neighborhoods differ greatly and provide for a wide variety of living environments."

    "My friend and his wife have no special financial limitations, as their employers subsidize their rent. However, they have a rather **long list of preferences**, as they do not wish to rely on private transportation and are looking for the most suitable environment to raise their two children. They have a six-year-old boy about to attend elementary school and a baby girl. They also have a dog. They wish to live in an area in which many venues are at a walking distance, which they consider to be approximately 500 meters. They are looking for a child-friendly environment, preferably a neighborhood with a relatively young demographic and many families with children."

    "The most fundamental requirement, as far as my friend and his wife are concerned, is that they want to rent a place adjacent to a elementary school. However, they would also like to live nearby a day care for toddlers; a playground for toddlers; a kindergarten; green areas; a dog garden; a pizzeria and ice cream parlor for their weekly “family tradition” and, preferably, a neighborhood bar (or pub), so that they could go on dates and easily return home quickly in case of an emergency. Additionally, my friend’s background is somewhat traditional. He thus strongly prefers not to expose his children to shady places such as strip clubs and would rather live far away from such places.

    "As indicated above, one of my friend’s main concerns is education. In Israel, there are different types of schools (public/private; Jewish/non-Jewish; secular/religious) and the education a student receives may differ greatly based on the school in which he or she are enrolled. My friend, for instance, wants to send his son to a public, Jewish, secular school, and does not know which schools in Tel Aviv fit these criteria. The Israeli Board of Education publishes this data. It is important to note that the Board of Education also [provides data](http://ic.education.gov.il/QvAJAXZfc/opendoc_pc.htm?document=ShkifutReports.qvw&host=qvsprodlb&sheet=SH02&lang=en-US) on the quality of each school (test scores, etc.), however, when I attempted to integrate this data I realized that it was partial and outdated (last updated in 2017). I consulted the “client” (i.e., my friend) and he asked that I discard this data, as he is currently less interested in the quality of the school and more focused on finding a neighborhood that would meet the holistic needs of his family. \n",
    "My project was originally intended to help my friend find a suitable place for him to live, by addressing his specific needs. However, the parameters he has set for me are not so unique; many of my friends consider similar parameters when deciding where to live and it will be easy to adapt this analysis to fit different parameters. I believe that this project could assist them in making informed decisions on their living situations. Thus, while I initially planned to choose a project in the field of finance, designed for a business-oriented target audience, I decided that it would be preferable to focus on a concrete problem designed to help an actual client, rather than on an abstract problem designed for theoretical clients. In so doing, I aspire to create a project that has real practical value, without compromising the main objective of the assignment, which is demonstrating my skillset using location data.      \n",
    "Therefore, the objective of my project is to explore and segment schools in Tel Aviv, based on the parameters that the client has set for me. The project is designed so that the client receives the relevant data on each cluster, thus allowing him to understand his possibilities, narrow down his choices and reach an informed decision independently.    \n"
